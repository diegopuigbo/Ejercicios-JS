In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Examples
makeNegative(1);    // return -1
makeNegative(-5);   // return -5

makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
Notes
The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

If the user guess is wrong it should return false and lose a life.

Task Overview:
You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:

cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.
If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.
